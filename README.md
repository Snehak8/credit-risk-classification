# credit-risk-classification
**Overview of the Analysis:**
The purpose of this analysis is to assess the performance of a logistic regression model in predicting credit risk. The dataset used contains information about loans, with labels indicating whether a loan is healthy (0) or at high risk of default (1). We split the data into training and testing sets, built a logistic regression model using the training data, and evaluated its performance on the testing data.

Results:
**Accuracy Score:** The accuracy score measures the proportion of correctly classified instances. It is an important metric but needs to be complemented by other metrics to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.
**Precision Score:** Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. It indicates the model's ability to avoid false positives.

**Summary:**
The logistic regression model demonstrated satisfactory performance in predicting both healthy and high-risk loans.
The precision, recall, and F1-score were relatively high for both categories, indicating that the model effectively predicts both healthy and high-risk loans.
The model's ability to balance between precision and recall suggests its usefulness in identifying loans at risk of default without excessively flagging healthy loans.
